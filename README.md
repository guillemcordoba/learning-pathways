# Learning Pathways (LeaP)

Collaborative and dynamic online learning.

## Grammar

- Skill: "how to's" to be learnt. Each skill has a test associated with it.
- Test: a short and simple process to assess whether the participant has the tested skill or not. It can take many forms (quiz, ordering, complex tasks, certifications...).
- Path: process of acquiring a skill, requiring a certain amount of effort. They can be a set of videos, text, puzzles, etc. A path can assume skills already known by the participant, and thus focus only on the important parts. 
- Concept: a skill can tag a word as a concept. Later, a participant can look for skills related to that concept.

## Process

Like in a map of a mountain, there are goals (skills) and paths to get there. The skills are defined by their test.

Any learner can create a skill, and paths to get there. Paths inherently assume skills to begin from.

Learners can take the tests at any time to see if they are ready to climb the path. Once the test is passed, that skill is marked as done. At any point in time, learners can select a skill that they don't have and try to climb a path towards it.

When someone climbs a path, it leaves a trail. The learner will give feedback about the path, which will aggregate with feedback from all other participants, to display visually a graph of all the possible paths to learn a skill, from the skill that the participant already knows.

- The width of the path shows how many people took that path.
- The length of the path indicates the amount of effort required to climb that path (average of time?).
- The color of the path indicates its difficulty.

When the learners select a skill that they don't have, they can compare the paths that they have available to get there a la google maps, and try to climb it.
